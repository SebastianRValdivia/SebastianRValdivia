## Hi, Iâ€™m @SebastianRValdivia

I'm an Argentine programmer who has always had a passion for creating things. It all started when I helped my dad build furniture for our home as a child, where I discovered the joy of working with tools and materials to create something new. From there, I developed a fascination for assembling, whether it was playing with Legos, magnetic blocks, or diving into video games like Minecraft. It was through these simple games and toys that I realized my calling: to build.

Years later, I stumbled upon a new way of building - programming. The rapid growth of software and technology intrigued me, and I was bursting with ideas that I wanted to bring to life. However, I knew that I needed to learn how to code first. So, I made the decision to enroll in university and graduate as a software engineer. But I've always considered myself self-taught at heart because my primary goal was to learn the subject, not just earn a degree.

In my programming journey, I gravitated toward free and open-source software, driven by the desire to understand how the tools I used actually worked. Naturally, I created my own Linux-based working environment and configured various tools manually. Over time, I became deeply connected to the open-source community and decided to contribute to it.

And last but not least, you may have already guessed my favorite hobby: writing. I have a passion for crafting stories, whether in books or through narration. I enjoy exploring and creating unique worlds with diverse characters, all while delving into the intricate realm of linguistics.
