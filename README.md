## Hi, Iâ€™m @SebastianRValdivia

I am an Argentine programmer. Since my youth I enjoy any activity that aims to build something. This rare pleasure in making began while I was assisting my dad in making furniture for our house, there I understood that working with materials and tools can create something new. Since then, I developed a taste for assembling, I loved playing with legos or magnetic blocks, or with video games like Minecraft. Between simple games and toys I discovered my vocation to build.

Years later I found a new way of building, programming. The exponential growth of software and computing in general caught my attention. I began to have a lot of ideas in my head that I was desperate to carry out, although I knew very well that first I have to learn to code. As soon as I had the opportunity to choose, I enrolled and graduated from a university to become a software engineer. Even so, I always called myself self-taught (although I attended an institution) because my objective was to learn a subject that I wanted to know in any way; not to obtain a degree.

When programming, I oriented myself towards the use of free and open software because I was fascinated by being able to understand how something I was using worked. As it was in my nature, it didn't take long to generate a working environment on Linux and other tools that I configured manually. Over time I felt a connection to the community and decided to contribute to it.

Finally, dear reader, you may have recognized my favorite hobby: writing. Something I also love building is stories. I love books, reading and narrating them, exploring and creating worlds with different characters, all this while I'm discovering the complex universe of linguistics.
